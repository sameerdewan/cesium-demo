## Cesium demo + react

Just for fun.
The purpose of this exercise was to try and utilize cesium with react, without having to rely on resium, so that I could tap into the core cesium library for maximum control of multiple viewers.

The core functionality is wrapped within the `useCesium` hook. Again, this is a quick exercise that hasn't been fully tested yet, so unless you're willing to explore further than I have, I wouldn't rely on this model out of the box.
